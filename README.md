# Welcome to my Github page.

Hi folks 👋

😁 I have just graduated from University of Cambridge as a PhD in Computer Science (degree received on 22th Oct 2021).

🔭 I’m currently looking for jobs in quant research/dev and machine learning fields.

🌱 I’m currently learning competitive programming skills used in IOI/ACM-ICPC to compensate for my regret in my past years.

🧮 I'm also interested in IMO problems, the reason why I want to learn them is the same as above.

💰 I’m trying to solve all kinds of interview questions in maths/cs.

💬 Ask me about mathemtaics and competitive programming.

📫 How to reach me: dr.leran.cai@gmail.com (this is a bit cocky 👀).

⚡ Fun fact: My Github profile was first noticed by other people because I wrote some solution notes to Mitzenmacher and Upfal's book. 

Some resolutions in 2022:

- [ ] Finish Mitzenmacher and Upfal's solution notes.
- [ ] Leetcode solutions to hard problems and notes.
- [ ] Codeforces/Atcoder expert.
- [ ] Maths notes: analysis, linear algebra, functional analysis, probability theory, statistics, combinatorics.
- [ ] Machine Learning notes.
- [ ] Algorithmic trading.
- [ ] Run 5km regularly.
